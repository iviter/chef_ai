        on your request for an Italian main course, I''ll provide a step-by-step recipe
        for Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, a classic Italian dish made with readily available
        ingredients.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts,
        cut into bite-sized pieces\n- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter\n- 3 cloves
        garlic, minced\n- 1 cup heavy cream\n- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (freshly
        grated is best)\n- 1 teaspoon dried basil\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n- 1/4 teaspoon
        black pepper\n- 1 cup fettuccine pasta\n- Fresh parsley, chopped (optional,
        for garnish)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Cook the Fettuccine:**\n   - Bring
        a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once boiling, add the fettuccine pasta.
        Cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of
        pasta water before draining the fettuccine.\n\n2. **Prepare the Chicken:**\n   -
        In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add the
        chicken pieces and cook until browned on all sides and cooked through, about
        5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.\n\n3. **Make
        the Alfredo Sauce:**\n   - In the same skillet (do not clean), add the remaining
        butter. Once melted, add the minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute, until
        fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic.\n   - Pour in the heavy cream
        and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let it cook for about 2-3 minutes or until
        it starts to thicken slightly.\n   - Reduce the heat to low and add the grated
        Parmesan cheese. Stir until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth.
        Season with basil, salt, and pepper.\n   - If the sauce seems too thick, you
        can add a bit of the reserved pasta water to thin it out.\n\n4. **Combine
        the Chicken and Fettuccine with Alfredo Sauce:**\n   - Add the cooked fettuccine
        pasta to the skillet with the Alfredo sauce. Toss the pasta in the sauce until
        well coated. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little more of the reserved
        pasta water.\n   - Add the cooked chicken back into the skillet and toss everything
        together until the chicken is well coated with the Alfredo sauce.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   -
        Serve the Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley
        if desired. Enjoy your delicious Italian main course!\n\nThis recipe should
        provide a satisfying and flavorful Italian main course experience.
