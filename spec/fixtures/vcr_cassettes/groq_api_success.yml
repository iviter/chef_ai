        Spaghetti with Tomato and Basil Sauce Recipe**\n\n Servings: 4-6\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n*
        12 oz (340g) spaghetti\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 4 garlic cloves, minced\n*
        1 can (28 oz/794g) crushed tomatoes\n* 1 cup (250g) fresh tomatoes, diced\n*
        1 cup (20g) fresh basil leaves, chopped\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* 1
        teaspoon dried oregano\n* 1/2 teaspoon dried basil\n* Grated Parmesan cheese,
        for serving (optional)\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Bring a large pot of salted
        water to a boil** and cook the spaghetti according to package instructions
        until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining the spaghetti.\n2.
        **Heat the olive oil in a large skillet** over medium heat. Add the minced
        garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, for 4-5 minutes or until fragrant.\n3.
        **Add the crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, dried oregano, and dried basil**
        to the skillet. Stir to combine, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 15-20
        minutes, stirring occasionally, allowing the sauce to thicken.\n4. **Stir
        in the chopped fresh basil** and season the sauce with salt and pepper to
        taste.\n5. **Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet** with the tomato sauce.
        Toss the spaghetti in the sauce, adding some reserved pasta water if the sauce
        seems too thick.\n6. **Serve the spaghetti hot**, topped with grated Parmesan
        cheese if desired.\n\n**Tips and Variations:**\n\n* Use high-quality ingredients,
        such as San Marzano tomatoes, for the best flavor.\n* Add protein like cooked
        ground beef, sausage, or chicken to the sauce for added flavor.\n* Mix in
        other vegetables, such as bell peppers or mushrooms, to add texture and nutrients.\n*
        Substitute other types of pasta, such as linguine or fettuccine, for a different
        texture.\n* Experiment with different herbs, such as parsley or oregano, to
        change the flavor profile.\n\n**Nutrition Information (per serving):**\n\n*
