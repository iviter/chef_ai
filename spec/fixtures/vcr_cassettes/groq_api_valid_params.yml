        Italian Tomato and Basil Pasta Recipe**\n\n Servings: 4\n Cooking Time: 30
        minutes\n Flavor Profile: Savory\n\n**Ingredients:**\n- 8 oz (225g) Pasta
        of your choice (e.g., Spaghetti, Fettuccine, or Penne)\n- 2 large Tomatoes,
        diced\n- 1/2 cup (120g) grated Cheese (e.g., Mozzarella, Parmesan, or a mix)\n-
        1/4 cup (15g) fresh Basil leaves, chopped\n- 2 tbsp Olive oil\n- Salt, to
        taste\n- Pepper, to taste\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare
        the Ingredients:**\n   - Rinse the tomatoes and basil leaves. Dice the tomatoes
        and chop the basil leaves.\n   - Grate the cheese if it''s not pre-grated.\n\n2.
        **Boil the Pasta:**\n   - Fill a large pot with water and place it on the
        stove over high heat.\n   - Once the water starts boiling, add a pinch of
        salt.\n   - Put the pasta into the boiling water.\n   - Cook according to
        the package instructions until the pasta is al dente (usually around 8-10
        minutes).\n   - Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining the pasta.\n\n3.
        **Prepare the Tomato and Basil Sauce:**\n   - In a large skillet, heat the
        olive oil over medium heat.\n   - Add the diced tomatoes to the skillet. Cook
        for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes start to soften.\n   -
        Add the chopped basil to the skillet and stir well. Season with salt and pepper
        to taste.\n   - Continue cooking for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors
        to combine.\n\n4. **Combine the Pasta and Sauce:**\n   - Add the cooked pasta
        to the skillet with the tomato and basil sauce.\n   - Toss the pasta in the
        sauce, ensuring the pasta is well coated. If the sauce seems too thick, add
        a bit of the reserved pasta water.\n\n5. **Add the Cheese:**\n   - Sprinkle
        the grated cheese over the pasta and sauce.\n   - Toss the pasta gently to
        distribute the cheese evenly. The heat from the pasta and sauce will start
        to melt the cheese.\n\n6. **Serve:**\n   - Divide the pasta among four plates.\n   -
        Serve immediately, garnished with additional basil leaves if desired.\n\n**Enjoy
